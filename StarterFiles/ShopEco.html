          <div  class="col-4"><h3>Analyze the businesses website from a desktop and mobile device point of view.</h3>
            Overview: User experience is more or less fine since the idea of the website is well concieved. Both Desktop and Mobile view have well established breaking points and media  queries. It has fun personality. Color theory is applied, provided good contrast between images, text and primary color. Accent color is eye catching and used approprietly. The key bad thing about it is, the images and CSS loads slowly on weak network.
  </div>
          <div  class="col-4"><h3>Note if the business is using, adaptive design, responsive design, native design,or some combination of them.</h3>
            
            Design: Combination of adaptive and responsive design. Navbar gets converted into burger menu on small screen. Moreover, box sizing is responsive to the viewport and grid layout is not applied.
          </div>
          <div   class="col-4"><h4>Note if they're using any sort of image responsive technologies that we've
            discussed in class</h4>
            Images: they are didn't used any responsive technologies
            </div></div>
            <div id="box"class="row" >
          <div  class="col-4"><h4>Note which resolutions, if any, they have the layout of their site change.</h4>layout of their site change at breakpoint of 999px </div>
          <div   class="col-4"><h4>Add a sentence or two about what you like and dislike about the mobile view of
            their site.</h4>
            Mobile View:
            1. Good: 
            - all features and box sizing is fine.
            - Image contrast according to the website personality is pretty good.
            2. Bad:
            - It takes a while to load.
            </div>
          <div  class="col-4"><h4>Add a sentence about something you would change on the website with respect
            to the mobile experience.</h4>
            Potential changes on the mobile view:
            - use efficient css, to load faster
            - should have sticky header 
            </div>
