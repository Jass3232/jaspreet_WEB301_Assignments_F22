        <div  class="col-4"><h3>Analyze the businesses website from a desktop and mobile device point of view.</h3>
          Overview: User experience is fine since the idea of the website is well concieved. Both Desktop and Mobile view have well established breaking points and media  queries. Color theory is applied, provided good contrast between images, text and primary color. Accent color is eye catching and used approprietly.
</div>
        <div  class="col-4"><h3>Note if the business is using, adaptive design, responsive design, native design,or some combination of them.</h3>
         
          Design:  Responsive design is used. Navbar gets converted into burger menu on small screen. Moreover, box sizing is responsive to the viewport. Grid layout is used for main parts of website</div>
        <div   class="col-4"><h4>Note if they're using any sort of image responsive technologies that we've
          discussed in class</h4>
          Images: they are using max-width, to auto-sizing.
          </div></div>

        <div  class="col-4"><h4>Note which resolutions, if any, they have the layout of their site change.
        </h4>layout of their site change at breakpoint of 899px 
        </div>
        <div   class="col-4"><h4>Add a sentence or two about what you like and dislike about the mobile view of
          their site.Mobile View:</h4>
          1. Good: 
          - all features and box sizing is fine
          - sticky header is handy in the UX
          2. Bad:
          - Images in the mobile view are not looking good, but on desktop.
          </div>
        <div  class="col-4"><h4>Add a sentence about something you would change on the website with respect
          to the mobile experience.</h4>
          Potential changes on the mobile view:
          - change images on mobile view
